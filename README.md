# Simple Countdown Timer

## Overview

**Animated timer with ability to set own end time and heading.**

This is a simple countdown timer that allows users to set a custom end time and heading. The project was created as a starter portfolio piece and as a tool for counting down to an event for a friend. The app is written in **Vanilla JS** as a warm-up before tackling projects in frameworks. The project also includes basic testing using **Jest**.

### Key Features

- **Animated Flip Effect:** The timer displays time using animated tiles with a flip effect.
- **Customizable:** Users can set their own heading and deadline using a popup.
- **Persistent Data:** User input is saved in browser cookies, ensuring it remains available on page reload.
- **Celebration:** Fireworks animation is triggered when the countdown reaches zero.
